        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and
          structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's
          appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>
        <p>"HyperText" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between
          websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to
          pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>HTML uses &#x22;markup&#x22; to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML
          markup includes special &#x22;elements&#x22; such as &#x3C;head&#x3E;, &#x3C;title&#x3E;, &#x3C;body&#x3E;,
          &#x3C;header&#x3E;, &#x3C;footer&#x3E;, &#x3C;article&#x3E;, &#x3C;section&#x3E;, &#x3C;p&#x3E;,
          &#x3C;div&#x3E;, &#x3C;span&#x3E;, &#x3C;img&#x3E;, &#x3C;aside&#x3E;, &#x3C;audio&#x3E;, &#x3C;canvas&#x3E;,
          &#x3C;datalist&#x3E;, &#x3C;details&#x3E;, &#x3C;embed&#x3E;, &#x3C;nav&#x3E;, &#x3C;output&#x3E;,
          &#x3C;progress&#x3E;, &#x3C;video&#x3E; and many others.</p>

        <p>The <code>&#60;header&#62;</code> represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or
          navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also other elements like a logo, a search form, an
          author name, and so on.

        <p>The <code>&#60;main&#62;</code> represents the dominant content of the &#60;body&#62; of a document. The main
          content area
          consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the
          central functionality of an application.
        </p>
        <p>A document must not have more than one &#x3C;main&#x3E; element that does not have the hidden attribute

          The <code>&#60;footer&#62;</code> represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root
          element. A footer
          typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related
          documents.
        </p>
        <code>
          &#x3C;footer&#x3E;
          Some copyright info or perhaps some author
          info for an &#x26;lt;article&#x26;gt;?

        <p>
          The <code>&#60;input&#62;</code> is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept
          data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the
          device and user agent.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The semantic pairing of &#x3C;input&#x3E; and &#x3C;label&#x3E; elements is useful for assistive
            technologies such as screen readers. By pairing them using the &#x3C;label&#x3E;&#x27;s for attribute, you
            bond the label to the input in a way that lets screen readers describe inputs to users more precisely.</li>
          <li>By pairing a &#x3C;label&#x3E; with an &#x3C;input&#x3E;, clicking on either one will focus the
            &#x3C;input&#x3E;. If you use plaintext to &#x22;label&#x22; your input, this won&#x27;t happen. Having the
            prompt part of the activation area for the input is helpful for people with motor control conditions.</li>
          <li>As web developers, it&#x27;s important that we never assume that people will know all the things that we
            know. The diversity of people using the web&#x2014;and by extension your web site&#x2014;practically
            guarantees that some of your site&#x27;s visitors will have some variation in thought processes and/or
            circumstances that leads them to interpret your forms very differently from you without clear and
            properly-presented labels.</li>

        <p>
          The <code>&#60;p&#62;</code> represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as
          blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML
          paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.
